# Summary

We are an [open-source](https://github.com/keyshade-xyz/keyshade) organization. We solely rely upon the contributions made from the peer of developers out there, and we are really thankful towards them. Even the smallest of contributions (changing the name of a variable, fixing typos) are very much appreciated.&#x20;

This series of documents aim at setting up and developing keyshade in your device locally. Start anywhere you feel like!
